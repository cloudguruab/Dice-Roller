# Yatzy 

# Objective
The objective here was to simulate a random 
set of numbers rolled from a dice. A lot like the 
game Yatzy I took time to modify special methods where
the user can check to see if each indexed number in their hand
matches a guess they give.  

# Instructions:

1. Create a class for the die
2. Create a class for the ways in which a user can guess. 
3. Create a class that allows our die to auto roll for us.
